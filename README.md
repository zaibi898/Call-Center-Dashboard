KPI'S Requirement

1.Total Number of Calls: We need to track and display the total number of calls received by our call
center over a specified period.

2.Total Call Duration in Hours: It is crucial to understand the total amount of time our call center staff spends on calls in hours, which can help us in resource allocation and capacity planning.

3.Total Call Duration in Minutes: Similar to the total call duration in hours, this KPI provides the total call time but in minutes, offering a more granular view of call durations.

4.Average Call Duration in Minutes: To assess the efficiency of our agents, we need to calculate and display the average call duration in minutes. This metric can help identify trends in call handling. 5.Response Time Percentage: Response time is a critical factor in customer satisfaction. This KPI should display the percentage of calls answered within a predefined time frame, helping us gauge our ability to provide prompt service.
